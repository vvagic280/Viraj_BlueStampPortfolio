# Remote Controlled Car
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

# Final Milestone
For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE

# Second Milestone
Since my previous milestone, I have worked on technical aspects of my project, including software and code integrated into the RC Car. I was able to upload code for the IR Remote to work with my car, and get it to move in the direction I want it to using the remote. I did this by having the car move in the direction I want it to by clicking the control once and letting it keep moving with no delay until I command it to either stop in place, or click a different control to move in a different direction. This way, I have the ease of not needing to constantly hold down the button and just let it continue to move in the direction I want it to until I click the "stop" command button or a different direction. A challenge I faced was the first code I found online didn't work like I wanted it to and just kept repeating the "stop" command repeatedly even when I didn't click any controls on the remote. I overcame this by editing some of the code and integrating some code from my previous upload of the IR Remote and got it to respond to the remote and get the motors running.

# First Milestone
My project is the RC Car and this is my first milestone. So far, I have completed piecing together the base of my project and have the overall hardware for the wires all plugged into the arduino UNO board. Some key components for this project include an ultrasonic sensor located in the front of the car for obstacle avoidance features, four motors for the tires to run the car, and an arduino UNO board to for plugging in the wires for all the components, a reciever; later used for the remote control, and a USB input to later integrate code into my project. A challenge I faced was not being able to plug in the camera; located on the top of the car, into the serial port on the arduino UNO because unfortunately with this chip I cannot plug both the camera, and the USB for uploading code, at the same time. My plan to complete this project is to get the motors up and running with the given IR (Infarred Remote) Control from the kit and get the ultrasonic sensors to work and avoid any objects in its path.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
